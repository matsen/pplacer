(*
* Inner loop:
*  - find minimally distant pair of samples i and j
*  - merge them to make k, and normalize
*  - remove those pairs from the distance map, then add
*  - calcualate distances between i and k and j and k
*  - recalculate distances
*
* The main data structures are
*  - barkm: the bark map for the clustering tree
*  - bmapr: map from blobs to the trees representing their clustering sequence
*  - cset: set of clusterables, playing the part of a distance matrix (see below)
*  - blobim: records the blobs and their indices, for export
