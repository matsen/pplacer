(* Run embarrassingly parallel computation in multiple processes.

   This module implements an event loop and some classes that operate on top of
   the event loop in order to fork, compute things in the new processes, and
   transfer ocaml values between processes. Basic example classes are provided
   which implement map, iter, and fold.

   For more complicated processes, the classes provided can be extended.
