(** Voronoi diagrams for phylogenetic trees with input set leaves.
 *
 * "Marks" are where colors are changed in the diagram, and colors flow up the
 * tree. That is, a mark sets the color of all edges proximal to that mark until
 * another mark is encountered.
 *
 * We only care about VDs when the set of interesting points are leaves or some
 * subset thereof. Thus we have at most one boundary per edge, as when the
 * points of interest are nodes of the phylogenetic tree.
