(*

We will be calculating the Bayes factors on taxonomic rank, and they
will guide us to an understanding of what taxonomic level is correct.
Let ranks be numbered such that increasing numbers mean more specific
taxonomic ranks (as in implementation.)

For each rank r we will calculate an evidence; this is P(D|M), where
in this case D is the posterior probabilities observed on the edges, and
M is the hypothesis that r is the correct rank for classification. We
will be marginalizing over the classifications themselves.

P(D|M) = \sum_{\theta \in \Theta} P(\theta | M) P(D | \theta, M)

Here, \theta is the actual classification, and \Theta is the set of
classifications at rank r.

P(\theta | M) is the prior given the rank. We will take it to be one
over the number of edges painted with classification \theta. The
probabilistically right thing to do would be to normalize this such that
the sum of the priors is one, but this would penalize more specific
classifications in cases where there were lots of choices. We can try it
out.

P(D | \theta, M) is the likelihood given the classification. In our
case, the term that matters is the sum of the posterior probabilities
for edges with classification theta.

So, for every placement and every rank, we want to report the evidence
for that rank, which will be the sum of the following over
classifications theta of that rank:

  [sum of the probability mass for all edges painted theta] /
  [number of edges painted theta]
