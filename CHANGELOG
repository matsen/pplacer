1.1.alpha03 to 1.1.alpha04
--------------------------

 * Closed GH-12: removed Placement.classif, and renamed

 * Closed GH-29: added ``guppy merge`` to merge multiple placefiles.
 * Closed GH-30: accepting \r, \n, and \r\n as delimiters everywhere in pplacer
   and guppy.
 * Closed GH-36: added ``guppy {classic,tog,sing,filter}``. The former three were

   a specific subset of their placements.
 * Closed GH-37: added a trailing newline to the end of json files.
 * Closed GH-38: added this changelog.
 * Bugfix in ``guppy classify``. From the commit:
     Previously, a file was being opened and closed for every pquery in every
     placerun. This resulted in only the last pquery being classified and
     written out. Now only one file is being opened for each placerun.
